# AI Project Analyst Agent

## Project Overview
The AI Project Analyst Agent is a web application that allows users to input a project idea and receive a complete, structured analysis from an LLM. The system evaluates the projectâ€™s difficulty, suggests a development pipeline, recommends a tech stack, estimates timeline and resources, outlines team roles and responsibilities, identifies risks, and provides a structured feasibility report.

This tool helps startups, developers, and project managers quickly assess the scope and requirements of any project.
